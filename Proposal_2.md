# IoT Helium Enterprise Level

## Background:

The Helium network is a decentralized network that uses hotspots for coverage to transmit data from IoT devices in the hotspot in order to analyse the data and perform certain tasks, and they incentivize people to setup hotspots by providing their HNT coins.

## Problem:

The problem is that the Helium network uses a low-power low-bandwidth network which makes it so local networks can't connect very many devices and the performance of the network won't be as good for an enterprise.

## Solution:

The solution is to use the helium network onto a network switch which will allow for many more connections to IoT devices such as cameras, movement sensors, etc. This will allow the IoT devices to transmit data to the network switch which will analyze it and send data back in order to perform a certain task. This will also allow for better performance which will be beneficial for an enterprise. Since, this is still on the Helium network, the rewards system will still be active which will eventually fund all the money that was used to invest for all of the hardware used for this network.

## Value Proposition:

For enterprises who needs a self-sufficient network that can connect multiple devices at a high performance to perform tasks, our Helium network using a network switch is a enterprise category that provides movement tracking, vandalism or crime tracking using camera data, etc. unlike current security systems.

## Use Case:

1. Tracking movement
1. analyse data from a camera for crime
1. be able to change building settings like the temperature
