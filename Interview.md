# Name: Thomas Gangemi - home owner 

##### Using app: Appfolio - an cloud-based property management software, services, and data analytics to the real estate industry that manages all real estate activities.
##### Disliking: App does not pull transactions from a bank account to the application. 
##### The Appfolio is associated with SmartRent and allows Thomas to rent a lock with a free of $2 a month (he has 3) which generates a new code every time there is a customer wanting to rent the property. 
##### He has a camera system where it has a $0 monthly fee and it is live stream every second. 
##### He disliked nothing about his camera system. 
##### He can control his system wherever has a wifi network and 5g.
